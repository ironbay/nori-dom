## Nori
Nori is an implementation of Virtual DOM + Diffing + Patching. It enables full UIs to be rendered server side with diffs streamed and applied to the client.

### Status
This library is still in progress and in research mode.  Currently it can create vdom on the backend and generate diff operations that can be streamed down to the client and applied using the JS library.
